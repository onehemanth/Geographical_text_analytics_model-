God almighty itself intervened,\" PTI quoted the court as saying.According to Bar&Bench, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said suggested that the petitions may not survive in light of the developments in the case, however, none of the petitioners, barring one agreed to withdraw their pleas.One of the petitioners, Amit Sahni,ï¿½said that these kind of protests should not be allowed in larger public interest.\"This was allowed to have continued for more than 100 days and people faced difficulty. This kind of incident should not have happened. Yesterday, there was \\'Chakka Jam\\' in Haryana. They have also called \\'Bharat Bandh\\' onï¿½24 and 25 September,\" he said.Advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for an intervenor, said that there was a right to peaceful protest and \"some people from a political party went there and created riots\".\"We have the right to protest. State machinery is not sacrosanct. Members of a political party went there with the police and created the situation,\" PTI quoted him as saying.Justice Bose said that the right to protest had to be balanced with the right of people to use a public road. \"For a long period of time, a public road was blocked. What about this right to use the road?\", LiveLaw quoted Bose as saying.When Pracha suggested that universal guidelines could be laid down for protests, the bench said:ï¿½\"We have to balance right to protest and the blocking of roads. We have to deal with the issue. There cannot be a universal policy as the situation may vary on a case-to-case basis.\"\"In a parliamentary democracy, protest can happen in Parliament and on roads but it has to be peaceful,\" it addedMehta, appearing for the Centre, said that the right to protest cannot be absolute and there are some judgements to this effect.Reserving its verdict, the bench said that it had appointed \"interlocutors\" in the Shaheen Bagh case as an experiment and they had suggested some measures which can be looked into.The top court had earlier heard the pleas, filed by Sahni, former BJP MLA Nand Kishore Garg and Ashutosh Dubey, against the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh.Sahni had earlier approached the high court seeking directions to Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which was blocked by anti-CAA protesters on 15 December. The high court had urged local authorities to deal with the situation, keeping in mind the law and order situation.Sahni has filed a special leave petition in the apex court against the high court\\'s order. The plea sought directions to the police to ensure smooth flow of traffic on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch.It also sought supervision of the situation in Shaheen Bagh, where several women were sitting in protest, by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court in order to avoid any violence.Separately, Garg, through his counsel Shashank Deo Sudhi, had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking directions to authorities to remove the protestors from Shaheen Bagh.Garg\\'s plea claimed that various other arterial roads of Delhi have been facing traffic congestion due to the protest at Shaheen Bagh.Alleging that the law enforcement machinery has been \"held hostage to the whims and fancies of the protesters,\" the plea sought laying down of guidelines for protests which led to obstruction of public places.\"It is disappointing that the State machinery is muted and is a silent spectator to hooliganism and vandalism of the protesters, who are threatening the existential efficacy of the democracy and the rule of law and had already taken the law and order situation in their own hand,\" the plea said.The State has a duty to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens, who have been facing trouble due to the road blockade, the plea further said.\"Hence, it is urgently required that public places must not be allowed to be abused and misused for ulterior and mala fide purposes such as staging a protest against a constitutional amendment in the heart of the capital city and thereby causing incalculable hardships and difficulties to the common people,\" it said.According to LiveLaw, the petition filed by Dubey, however, stated that the protests could continue after the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic was over.With inputs from PTI\\r', {'entities': [[0, 17, 'ORGANISATION'], [33, 156, 'INCIDENT'], [330, 342, 'AREA'], [372, 382, 'DATE'], [412, 419, 'NAME'], [421, 435, 'NAME'], [441, 455, 'NAME'], [603, 628, 'AREA'], [645, 650, 'AREA'], [683, 694, 'DATE'], [1041, 1053, 'NAME'], [1247, 1257, 'NAME'], [1513, 1521, 'STATE'], [1559, 1581, 'DATE'], [1601, 1615, 'NAME'], [1947, 1951, 'NAME'], [2160, 2164, 'NAME'], [2180, 2186, 'NAME'], [2778, 2790, 'AREA'], [2927, 2932, 'NAME'], [2949, 2966, 'NAME'], [2971, 2985, 'NAME'], [3020, 3038, 'AREA'], [3149, 3174, 'AREA'], [3228, 3240, 'DATE'], [3528, 3553, 'AREA'], [3609, 3621, 'AREA'], [3727, 3732, 'CITY'], [3787, 3791, 'NAME'], [3813, 3831, 'NAME'], [3939, 3958, 'AREA'], [4009, 4014, 'CITY'], [4073, 4094, 'AREA'], [5100, 5105, 'NAME']]}], [\"Lakhs of migrant workers who returned to their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh during the lockdown are eagerly waiting for their ration cards in order to avail subsidised food grains allocated under the Public Distribution System in this time of crisis under. An RTI reply has revealed the state has over 18 lakh ration card applications pending with a whopping 91.9 percent of them pending beyond the stipulated 30 days for approval.Uttar Pradesh has witnessed maximum number of migrant workers in the country with more than 31 lakhs having returned from other states during the lockdown, the state's chief secretary had informed on 4 June, 2020.On 12 May, 2020, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had given specific directions that those in need and eligible for subsideised ration should be provided with ration cards, including migrant workers.Between late March when the lockdown was announced in India and the month of May, the state has reportedly issued more than 5.8 lakh ration cards. Yet, 18,84,537 (or 10.2 percent) of the total applications for new ration cards are pending in the state.In all, the state received 1,85,57,659 applications under the State e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway (SSDG) system run by the Food and Civil Supplies Department of Uttar Pradesh. This information has been provided by the department in response to an RTI application filed by this author.While the response from the department does not mention the time period in which these applications were received, the date mentioned for the data compiled by the department is 31 July, 2020.The author has enquired from the department regarding the time period for the applications received and the details are awaited.As per the RTI response, out of the total pending applications, only 1,58,251 or 8.1 percent are pending within the stipulated time period of 30 days for application approval, while 17,31,686 (or a whopping 91.9 percent) are those pending beyond 30 days.Of the total 1.86 crore applications received, the department has accepted 61,29,525 applications (or 33 percent) while 1,05,43,597 (or 56.8 percent) applications have been rejected.Over 30 lakh migrant workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh during Lockdown. APThe information released via RTI also gives a district-wise breakdown of the ration card applications as well. Out of total 75 districts in the state, the highest number of applications have been received in Sitapur district in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. The district also has the highest number of rejections.The least number of applicatios were received in Sonbhadra district in Western Uttar Pradesh. Sonbhadra also ranks lowest in terms of ration card applications approved, rejected as well as pending. Kanpur Nagar in central Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of applications awaiting approval.Among the four regions in Uttar Pradesh ï¿½ Western, Eastern, Central and Bundelkhand ï¿½ the highest average number of applications per district have been received in Central Uttar Pradesh while the least have been received in the Bundelkhand region.An analysis of the ration card applications processed by the Food and Civil Supplies Department as stated in the RTI response, revealed a strong positive correlation between the average gross domestic product (GDP) per district (as per the 2017-18 official data from Uttar Pradesh Directorate of Economics and Statistics) and the average number of applications received per district in each of the four regions.Analysis of total applications shows that the more is the average GDP per district of a particular region, the more are the average number of applications received, betraying the logic that people in wealthier regions are less reliant on PDS.However, an analysis of the total existing ration card holders in the four regions paints the opposite picture.There is a fairly strong negative correlation between the region-wise average GDP per district and the average existing ration card holders per district, respectively. What this means is that the more is the average GDP per district of the region, the lesser is the average number of ration card holders per district in each region.Table 1: Region-wise Ration Card StatisticsRegionsNumber of Applications ReceivedAverage Gross Net Product per District (Crores)Average Ration Cards per DistrictBundelkhand118317.48898.393473909.9Central UP368249.222130.62363557.7Eastern UP237428.312363.66504035.3Western UP250992.422034.79485337.2Source: UP Directorate of Economics and Statistics (for economic data); Food and Civil Supplies Department (for ration card data, accessed on 4 September 2020); RTI response (ration card applications)ï¿½As of 4 September, the total number of ration cards in the state stood at more than 3.58 crores with more than 3.17 crores priority households, which include both the Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Above Poverty Line (APL) households as per the National Food Security Act 2013 (NFSA).

It should be noted that the region is widely perceived as underdeveloped and suffering from large scale hunger.In fact, Bundelkhand is the only region with a strong negative correlation between the per capita income of districts and the number of applications, ie, the more is the per capita income the lesser is the number of applications received in the districts of the region.Incidentally, Bundelkhand has had more per capita availability of food grains than the state average as observed between years 1997 and 2006 in the 2009 study on the region by AK Singh, A Joshi and Nomita P Kumar from the Giri Institute of Development Studies.Central Uttar Pradesh which includes important administrative and business districts such as Lucknow and Kanpur, though with the lowest average number of ration card holders per district in the state, has received maximum average number of applications per district.A large backlog of pending applications and the return of more than 30 lakh migrant workers is a worrying combination. Moreover, the pending applications also include those received before the current crisis. The introduction of new ration cards in the state in 2016 replacing the old ones had left many erstwhile ration card holders without one. These ration cards are also a prerequisite for availing benefits for many other schemes such as Ujjwala Gas Yojana (scheme).While the lockdown has spelled disaster for returning migrant workers, those eligible for ration cards who were already living here and have been hit hard by the suspension of economic activity also urgently need them. With slow resumption of economic activity many of the applicants, especially those belonging to the unorganised sector require immediate relief in form of ration allocated under the NFSA.\\r\", {'entities': [[60, 73, 'STATE'], [420, 442, 'STATE'], [629, 644, 'DATE'], [645, 657, 'DATE'], [659, 672, 'STATE'], [688, 703, 'NAME'], [866, 871, 'DATE'], [907, 912, 'COUNTRY'], [921, 933, 'DATE'], [1274, 1288, 'STATE'], [1574, 1591, 'DATE'], [2198, 2211, 'STATE'], [2439, 2455, 'DISTRICT'], [2467, 2481, 'STATE'], [2586, 2604, 'DISTRICT'], [2616, 2630, 'STATE'], [2631, 2640, 'DISTRICT'], [2735, 2747, 'DISTRICT'], [2759, 2772, 'STATE'], [2856, 2869, 'STATE'], [2902, 2913, 'CITY'], [3002, 3015, 'STATE'], [3058, 3069, 'CITY'], [3344, 3357, 'STATE'], [5169, 5180, 'CITY']]}], [\"Azamgarh: A four-seater training aircraft crashed in Uttar Pradesh's Azamgarh on Monday, leaving its pilot dead, official sources said.The aircraft crashed into an agricultural field in Kushaha Fariuddinpur village under the Sarai Mir police station area around 11.30 am due to bad weather conditions, they said.The aircraft had taken off from a training institute and was being used by a trainee pilot, District Magistrate, Azamgarh, Rajesh Kumar said.

The Indian economy has contracted by a staggering 23.9 percent in the first quarter of the current financial year ï¿½ with the labour-intensive construction sector reporting a massive slump of 50.3 percent. For a sector that was already under stress before the pandemic due to the poor financial health of many companies and dwindling output, this news has come as a shocker.But more significantly, the data provide a frightening picture of the impact the pandemic has had on the construction workers- a glimpse of which was also visible from the mass exodus of migrant workers to their villages during the lockdown.A rapid assessment survey conducted by Habitat for Humanityï¿½s Terwilliger Center for Innovation in Shelter interviewed 974 respondents to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 on migrant workers in Maharashtraï¿½s Pune and Ulhasnagar. The report reveals that nearly half the respondents belonged to the construction industry (47 percent), followed by bag manufacturing (23ï¿½percent), garment industry (13ï¿½percent) and the remaining 17ï¿½percent to other sectors. At least, 71ï¿½percent of all respondents received no wages after the lockdown and over 63ï¿½percent claimed to have no source of livelihood at their places of origin.The survey presents a distressing picture of the plight of migrant workers in the construction sector and other industries - and what the 50ï¿½percent fall in construction output means for the many who depend on it.Impact on the construction industry and its workforceThe construction industry in India is the second largest employer after agriculture and has an industry size of Rs 10.5 trillion. According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, prior to the lockdown, there were 20,000 ongoing construction projects in the country and work was being undertaken in as many as 18,000 sites.Together, these projects involved a workforce of over 8.5 million. Moreover, demand from affordable housing segment is expected to decline significantly due to constrained spending capacity of the target group. With more than 6.1 lakh affordable houses under construction buoyed by policy fillip such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the resultant growth in recent years ï¿½ muted demand, reduced cash flows, labour shortage and cost escalations could severely hamper revival of the sector. When output from the sector is lost, the jobs and the incomes generated from those jobs are also lost. The loss in incomes was observed even in the Terwilliger Center survey, with only 16 percent of all workers interviewed receiving the same wages as before lockdown, and the remaining 84 percent receiving much less or no income. Further, even from the workers who received the wages, only around 10ï¿½percent found it sufficient enough to help them through the lockdown.With no money in hand and no alternative livelihood in the destination states, migrant workers were forced to rely on welfare measures from the government. Data from the Terwilliger Center survey shows that about 28ï¿½percent of them received no form of help or support from the government ï¿½ putting their very lives at risk. It is no surprisem therefore, that almost 26ï¿½percent of the workers suffered hunger during the lockdown, with little or no access to food. In fact, for 40ï¿½percent workers, access to food and ration was one of their biggest concerns.In such a situation, the existence of active social protection for workers becomes imperative. The construction sector has two laws to provide protection and dignity to its workforce. The first, the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and conditions of service) Act 1996 regulates the employment and conditions of service of building and other construction workers, and provides for their safety, health, and welfare. The second, the BOCW Cess Act, provides for the levy and collection of cess on the cost of construction incurred by employers, with a view to augment the resources of the BOCW Welfare Boards,ï¿½used to provide for these workers.The rapid assessment survey highlights the glaring inadequacy of the workersï¿½ registration system under the Act: 96ï¿½percent of the workers in the construction sector were not registered under the BOCW Act and thus could not avail its relief package. The survey further reveals that among the 455 respondents employed in the construction sector, 62 percentï¿½ were not even aware of BOCW, while 20ï¿½percent were aware of BOCW, but could not register themselves.To put this in perspective, in June 2020, Ministry of Labour and Employment stated that 20 million workers registered under BOCW were provided cash assistance during the lockdown. As per Indiaï¿½s Periodic Labour Force Survey of employment and unemployment, there were nearly 55 million construction workers in 2017ï¿½18. This demonstrates that only about 36ï¿½percent of the construction workers received the cash entitlements they deserved, making the situation precarious for the large majority of the workers, and often leaving them to fend for themselves.In reality, a large number of workers in the construction industry have been living in precarious conditions even before the pandemic. This is dueï¿½to the rampant informality present in the construction sector, primarily due to its reliance on migrant labour recruited through a series of sub-contracting processes. About 87.4ï¿½percent of workers in the construction sector have been categorised as casual labour, according to the PLFS 2017-18, highlighting the level of informality that prevails in the industry.Informality is also evident through subcontracting ï¿½ a process deeply embedded within the building construction work. A typical example of a sub-contracting hierarchy involves a realty and infrastructure company handing over specialised tasks to specific subcontracting companies, which in turn delegate hiring responsibilities to petty contractors, who may or may not have an appropriate license. These petty contractors, also known as labour sub-contractors, are responsible for recruiting and onboarding workers. Thus, the structure of recruitment is complex, multi-layered and hierarchical, especially in large construction firms.Petty contractors in such contracting value chain play a crucial role in mobilising large number of labourers needed by the construction industry. The heavy reliance on these contractors was evident from the survey as well; majority of the construction workers (58 percent) surveyed relied on contractors to find jobs, while 26 percentï¿½found employment on their own and 13ï¿½percent through referrals from friends or relatives.Labour economist Ravi Srivastava talks about how this dependence on contractors is more common among short term migrants, in this 2020 paper. \"Short term migrants are much more likely to enter the migrant labour market through contractors from whom they have taken an advance payment and are more likely to be involved in a debt-interlocked migration cycle,\"ï¿½he writes.In addition, these short-term migrant workers are largely characterised by an absence of civic identity and citizenship at destination, poorer access to entitlements, labour market discrimination and working and living in substandard conditions. Though significant progress has been made in providing housing for economically weaker sections through the PMAY scheme, short-term migrants, who are multilocal in nature, are left out and often end up living in inadequate shelter in cities as they could neither afford nor access decent housing.They face double marginalisation in the destination states, owing to their identity as outsiders and also due to the informal nature of their occupation. They resort to living in labour colonies and rented accommodation in informal settlements, with no access to basic services. Further, the living conditions of such migrants are congested in nature and conducive for the rapid spread of viruses and diseases. The survey corroborated this - out of all migrant workers surveyed, only 15ï¿½percent had access to all necessary conditions required for prevention of COVID-19, such as access to serviceable toilets, clean drinking water, water for washing hands, and enough space to practice physical distancing.All this is emblematic of a larger malaise prevailing in the system- marked by an absence of social protection to the workforce that runs the economy. Seen from this perspective, the 50 percent fall in GVA of the construction sector could exacerbate hunger, loss of livelihood, and lead to distress migration and lack of dignity for workers. Findings from the Terwilliger Center study and several other field assessments since March 2020 indicate the prevalence of all these aspects in the lives of migrant workers.Beyond the official dataThere is a highï¿½likelihood that the decline of over 50 percent in the activity of the construction sector has been under-reported. This is because a countryï¿½s GDP, as economist Vivek Kaul writes, is based on formal-sector indicators; and the real state of the huge informal sector can be captured only over a period of time, as more and more data come in, not immediately. In India, given that data-collection was affected drastically during the lockdown and that the construction industry is subject to rampant informality and substantial sub-contracting, the impact on the sector, both in terms of loss of output and employment is likely to be worse.For instance, KPMGï¿½s report on the impact of COVID-19 in the construction sector predicted a fall in the Gross Value Added of the construction sector to be 34ï¿½percent, (in the worst case scenario of the lockdown extending to 30 June) and the consequent fall in employment to be 25ï¿½percent (corresponding to the 34ï¿½percent fall in GVA). However, the latest fall in the construction sector GVA of 50.3ï¿½percent, based on partial data collection, belies all such expectations. More so, given the nature of construction industry, a fall in output would have a multiplier effect through backward linkages, causing further reduction of the economic activity and job losses. However, all is not lost yet.The rural economy and the role of housingWith a protracted economic recovery looming large, especially in industries such as construction that are dependent on migrant labour, there is an urgent need to revive the rural economy. Transitional remedial measures such as PM Garib Kalyan Yojana and enhanced budget allocation and expansion of works as well as workdays under MGNREGA can help in the short term revival but may not be sufficient given the magnitude of crisis and jobs to be created.Extending the PMAY Gramin programï¿½s tenure and upskilling returnee construction labour on rural masonry skills can create more sustainable jobs besides productively utilizing their skills acquired in cities. This can also lead to improved quality of housing construction under PMAY Gramin.According to a recent GIZ report Improving Housing for Urban Poor - Learnings from BLC Implementation in Odishaï¿½, it can be seen that 76 percent of PMAY beneficiaries are labourers and 56 percent infact are construction labourers. It is well known that remittances from migrant labour working in cities partly goes towards housing improvements in their hometowns. The current situation presents an opportunity to address the housing gaps among migrant households and enlist those who were left out; and also resolve the issue of incomplete houses caused by migration of beneficiaries to other places for work. Housing has also become the frontline defense against the coronavirus and in this context it is imperative that every migrant worker has access to adequate housing, in both origin and destination states.Willingness to migrate againOne of the important findings of the survey is that, despite the hardships endured in the place of work and in subsequently travelling back to their villages, 59 percent of surveyed migrants expressed willingness to return to their destination state. This willingness was higher among construction workers, where 68ï¿½percent expressed willingness to return to the destination state once the government allowed interstate travel. For many of these construction workers (76 percent), the lack of livelihood options in the origin state was a key driver influencing their decision. Not surprisingly, the survey reveals that the migrant workers\\' willingness to return to their place of work was contingent upon the employer providing them with travel arrangements, food and a safe, clean and hygienic workplace and proper accommodation- all basic necessities.Further, because of the nature of the construction sector, petty contractors are the key linchpins in recruiting workers and offering informal intermediation services to employers in mobilising labour. The survey suggests that builders and construction firms should step up in formally recognising their role and paying for their services, while keeping the relationship between the worker and employer linear. Employers can also explore partnerships with civil society organizations to sensitise, train and expand the services of petty contractors as facilitators of entitlements to migrant workers in the destination states.As a significant number of migrant workers are employed in the construction sector, implementation issues in the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Act must be addressed immediately. The welfare boards in destination states need to be inclusive and ease the registration process for migrant workers. One way to do that is by engaging with petty contractors to scale up migrant worker registrations. At the same time, builders and construction firms who contribute cess to the state governments must hold the state BOCW welfare boards accountable and ensure delivery of entitlements for registered workers.Doing away with domicile restrictions to access the Public Distribution System would ensure food security of migrants in the destination states as they return. As regards housing, India does not have a legal framework for the right to housing, which makes it difficult for migrants to acquire shelter and they end up relying on intermediaries or petty contractors for accommodation. Finding sustainable ways to develop and operate the affordable rental housing complexes for migrant workers through market-based models and utilising the Construction Workers Welfare Board funds for housing of migrant construction workers as recommended by the Working Group on Migration in 2017, could go a long way in improving the quality of lives of workers as well as help revive the GDP by rekindling demand.To access the full report, click herePriyansha is with India Migration Now, a South East Migration Foundation Venture based in Mumbai, India.

I have a hunch that the state government knowingly provides them shelter to reap political benefits.ï¿½Ghosh alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was not cooperating with the Centre in getting land for erecting fences along the porous borders with Bangladesh because terror operatives who sneak in from the neighbouring country work towards her political purpose.ï¿½The TMC and the terrorists have a give and take policy. The TMC helps infiltrators get false nationality documents and now, the party is colluding with the Maoists and Islamic terrorists to eliminate their political opponents,ï¿½ Ghosh later said.Notably, the three others who were arrested from Ernakulam district in Kerala in a simultaneous raid by the NIA also hail from Murshidabad.Over the past five years, Central and state agencies have arrested alleged operatives of the IS, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh, or JMB, from the state. Bengal shares 2,217 kilometres of border with Bangladesh. Nearly half it remains unfenced to date.In a press statement issued on Saturday, the NIA said that ï¿½large quantity of incriminating materials including digital devices, documents, jihadi literature, sharp weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature used for making home-made explosive devicesï¿½ had been seized from the possession of the arrested persons.They were ï¿½radicalised by Pakistan-based Al-Qaeda terrorists on social mediaï¿½ and ï¿½were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places including the National Capital Regionï¿½, the NIA said, adding that they were ï¿½actively indulging in fundraisingï¿½ and that some of them had a plan to visit New Delhi procure arms and ammunition.On Sunday, the BJPï¿½s state unit general secretary Sayantan Basu upped the ante on the state government, saying the party had been rightly pointing out since 2014 that there was a plan to turn West Bengal into West Bangladesh.ï¿½We warned that the governmentï¿½s patronage of unregulated madrasahs was creating (Osama bin) Laden-factories. The latest arrests were of persons born and brought up here. We no longer have only terrorists who infiltrated from Bangladesh and got their (nationality) documents here but now we also have our homegrown ones, thanks to the chief ministerï¿½s policy of going to any extent to appease a community of 30 percent,ï¿½ Basu said.Bengal BJP leaders use ï¿½thirty percentï¿½ usually to refer to Muslims, who made 27 percent of the stateï¿½s population, according to the Census of 2011.The TMC tried to divert the salvos at the Centre. ï¿½The border is protected by the Border Security Force (BSF), which operates under the Union government. What were the BSF and other Central agencies doing when dangerous terrorists crossed over the borders?ï¿½ TMC Lok Sabha MPs Sougata Roy asked. Kalyan Banerjee, also a Lok Sabha MP, echoed him.However, political analysts and independent observers said the arrests were going to add to the BJPï¿½s ammo for their political campaign in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections, as the spread of Islamic terror networks in the state has been one of the BJPï¿½s key issues against the state government over the past six years.The reaction of Sujan Chakraborty, the leader of the Left parties in the state Assembly, indicated that he apprehended the BJP would gain mileage from these arrests. ï¿½What was the state administration doing? Were they sleeping? Why are they giving opportunities to the Centre?ï¿½ he asked.ï¿½Far-reaching impactï¿½Psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University in Kolkata, said that the Murshidabad arrests were going to have ï¿½a far-reachingï¿½ impact on the stateï¿½s politics ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections.ï¿½Terror links to the state have helped the BJP since 2014 in building its campaign branding the Mamata Banerjee government as a patron of Islamic radicalism. Now, itï¿½s time for their campaign to intensify,ï¿½ the psephologist said.Bengalï¿½s link to cross-border terror organisations first came to the limelight in October 2014, when an accidental blast at Khagragarh in Burdwan district opened the lid of a flourishing network of JMB across the districts of Murshidabad, Birbhum, Burdwan, and Nadia -- all having a significant Muslim population.The JMB was banned in Bangladesh in 2005 and the investigation in the 2014 blast revealed some of Bangladeshï¿½ most-wanted terrorists were building the organisationï¿½s India networks staying in West Bengal over the past few years.Soon after the revelation of JMB links to the Khagragarh blast, the BJP and other organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ï¿½ such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Hindu Jagran Manch ï¿½ launched a sustained campaign seeking ï¿½jihadi-mukto Banglaï¿½, or a Bengal free from Islamic terror operatives.Since then the NIA, and the state police as well, made a series of arrests of operatives linked to the JMBï¿½s pro-Al Qaeda faction and the pro-IS faction, from different Bengal districts. Some of them were associated with small, unregulated madrasahs is nondescript localities. Some of the blast accused were later arrested by authorities in Bangladesh after they crossed over to that country. Overall, more than two dozen JMB operatives, including Indian and Bangladeshi nationals, have been arrested from the state.In 2017, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), or the highest decision-making body of the RSS, adopted a resolution expressing ï¿½grave concern over the unabated rise in violence by Jehadi elements in West Bengal, encouragement to the anti-national elements by the state government due to its Muslim vote bank politicsï¿½. The resolution called upon ï¿½the countrymen to create awareness against this Jihadi violence and communal politics of the state governmentï¿½.During the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 when the state witnessed widespread protests against the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), Bengal BJP leaders repeatedly cited terror operativesï¿½ links with the state to justify their demand for a citizenship screening exercise to weed out infiltrators.After Saturdayï¿½s arrests, Ajay Kumar Nandi, the eastern regional sanghachalak (president) of the RSS, said that the state government must take the responsibility for the mushrooming of terror networks.ï¿½There should be a ceaseless flow of information between the state government and the Centre on terrorist activities. But there is no claim even on part of the state government that they supplied the Centre with any information. This is a question of national security and politics should have no part in influencing a governmentï¿½s role. The state government will have to answer before the people,ï¿½ Nandi said.Political observers said they could foresee the political ramifications of the arrests. According to Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, a former principal of Presidency College in Kolkata, the BJP will sharpen its campaign against the state government and the stateï¿½s ruling party will find itself in a defensive position.ï¿½The BJP has been saying for the past five-six years that Bengal has turned into a hub of terrorist activities due to Mamata Banerjeeï¿½s policies that encouraged infiltration. They also accused her of giving patronage to radical Islamists. Now, they will claim to be standing vindicated,ï¿½ Mukhopadhyay said.Biswanath Chakraborty said that the BJP will also look the exploit the issue projecting the rationality of the CAA and NRC.ï¿½The TMC will remain quiet and take a soft stance, without committing itself to any position. They certainly do not want to be seen as acting against the national interest. However, the TMC is more than likely to launch a whispering campaign and make attempts to find a converging point with the voices that allege socio-economically backward Muslims are being unjustly targeted by the Centre,ï¿½ Chakraborty said.Recent rapid activities The NIA stepped up its activities involving possible terror links to West Bengal in 2020. They have registered as many as six cases of suspected terrorist activities involving the state in this year, compared to only one each in 2016, 2015, and 2014. Most of the arrests of alleged JMB operatives that took place during 2014 and 2019 were connected to the accidental blast in Burdwan in 2014.In April 2020, the NIA took over the investigation into the case of a 21-year-old women college studentï¿½s alleged links with Lashkar-e-Taiba. Tania Parvin, a resident of Baduria in North 24-Parganas district, an area bordering Bangladesh, was first arrested by the state police in March.The second case that the NIA took over in April was regarding the discovery of a major illegal firecracker factory at Naihati area in North 24-Parganas district. A fire at the factory led to a blast, causing five deaths on the spot and leaving two others badly injured.In May, the NIA took over a case of January 2020 in which the home of a Malda resident was found to be a storehouse of explosives. This storage, too, had come to the light after an explosion took place at the residence.Early in September, the NIA took over the investigation into two cases from the state police. One of them was a one-year-old case of an explosion at the home of a resident of Birbhum district. The state police had started an investigation in September 2019. The other case, too, was of storage of explosives and crude bombs at the home of a Birbhum district resident. The state police had started an investigation in the previous month.Besides, the special task force of Gujarat policed picked up a man from North 24-Parganas district in August for having LeT links.The NIA also reopened an 11-year-old case against Chhatradhar Mahato, who served as a spokesperson of a Maoist-backed tribal outfit during 2008-09. He was released earlier this year after serving 10 years in jail and joined the TMC soon after. TMC leaders had alleged that the NIA was being used by the Centre to harass and intimidate Mahato. After facing the NIAï¿½s grilling several times in August, Mahato has now been asked to appear before an NIA court.Ranjit Sur, vice-president of Association for Protection of Human Rights (APDR), the stateï¿½s largest human rights organisation, said he suspects the NIA could be acting in the political interests of the BJP. He was expecting arrests of more persons from West Bengal with alleged terror links in the coming days, he said.ï¿½We do not yet know much about the persons arrested from Murshidabad and Ernakulam. However, the role of NIA into the investigation of Maharashtraï¿½s Elgar Parishad case and the recent reopening of a case against Chhatradhar Mahato prompts us to strongly suspect political interest behind NIAï¿½s moves. It has come to our knowledge that the persons arrested from Murshidabad were associated with the movement against CAA. There are reasons to suspect that the arrests could be an attempt to weaken the anti-CAA movement,ï¿½ Sur said.Incidentally, Ghosh, too, spoke of the anti-CAA movement with reference to the Murshidabad arrests.ï¿½Murshidabad turns out to be a hub of terrorists. From JMB to Al Qaeda, every terror group has a presence here. And it was Murshidabad where the anti-CAA movement took the most violent shape in the state. It appears that I had rightly pointed out at that time (December 2019) that the anti-CAA protesters indulging in violence had terror links,ï¿½ Ghosh said on Sunday.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a TMC Rajya Sabha MP said that the party would take time before coming to any conclusion on whether there has been any political motive behind these arrests.ï¿½Our government is very serious about terror networks and the state police have made a series of arrests. However, we are aware that the BJP has a plan to frame rules for the CAA in the coming few months and re-launch its campaign in support of the CAA ahead of the Assembly elections. At present, we prefer to watch their next steps,ï¿½ the Rajya Sabha MP said.The CAA, which offers citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from Indiaï¿½s neighbouring Islamic countries, is one of the BJPï¿½s key weapons to win over the Bangladeshi Hindu refugees settled in West Bengal. The TMC has been strongly opposing both CAA and NRC, accusing the former of being discriminatory towards Muslims.The author is a Kolkata-based journalist and author of ï¿½Mission Bengal: A Saffron Experimentï¿½\\r', {'entities': [[0, 7, 'CITY'], [42, 71, 'ORGANISATION'], [117, 125, 'ORGANISATION'], [142, 155, 'STATE'], [156, 167, 'DISTRICT'], [190, 197, 'COUNTRY'], [256, 262, 'STATE'], [405, 411, 'STATE'], [606, 617, 'NAME'], [691, 702, 'COUNTRY'], [737, 772, 'ORGANISATION'], [775, 783, 'ORGANISATION'], [797, 810, 'ORGANISATION'], [864, 876, 'STATE'], [968, 983, 'NAME'], [1012, 1027, 'NAME'], [1130, 1140, 'COUNTRY'], [1402, 1409, 'ORGANISATION'], [1414, 1432, 'ORGANISATION'], [1474, 1479, 'NAME'], [1540, 1558, 'DISTRICT'], [1562, 1568, 'STATE'], [1599, 1602, 'ORGANISATION'], [1618, 1634, 'DISTRICT'], [1723, 1725, 'ORGANISATION'], [1727, 1742, 'ORGANISATION'], [1754, 1784, 'ORGANISATION'], [1810, 1816, 'STATE'], [1856, 1867, 'COUNTRY'], [1953, 1956, 'ORGANISATION'], [2294, 2308, 'COUNTRY'], [2309, 2317, 'ORGANISATION'], [2450, 2453, 'ORGANISATION'], [2560, 2569, 'CITY'], [2648, 2661, 'NAME'], [2755, 2759, 'DATE'], [2790, 2801, 'STATE'], [2812, 2826, 'COUNTRY'], [2905, 2914, 'NAME'], [3049, 3059, 'COUNTRY'], [3244, 3248, 'NAME'], [3484, 3505, 'ORGANISATION'], [3678, 3689, 'NAME'], [3697, 3712, 'NAME'], [4088, 4105, 'NAME'], [4393, 4414, 'NAME'], [4506, 4517, 'DISTRICT'], [4683, 4687, 'DATE'], [4726, 4741, 'NAME'], [4941, 4953, 'DATE'], [4983, 4993, 'CITY'], [4997, 5013, 'DISTRICT'], [5085, 5096, 'DISTRICT'], [5098, 5105, 'DISTRICT'], [5107, 5114, 'DISTRICT'], [5120, 5125, 'DISTRICT'], [5194, 5204, 'COUNTRY'], [5208, 5212, 'DATE'], [5242, 5246, 'DATE'], [5270, 5281, 'COUNTRY'], [5338, 5343, 'COUNTRY'], [5364, 5375, 'STATE'], [5446, 5456, 'CITY'], [5514, 5541, 'ORGANISATION'], [5562, 5583, 'ORGANISATION'], [5592, 5610, 'ORGANISATION'], [5651, 5672, 'ORGANISATION'], [5679, 5710, 'ORGANISATION'], [5737, 5740, 'ORGANISATION'], [5831, 5843, 'ORGANISATION'], [5860, 5866, 'ORGANISATION'], [5891, 5897, 'STATE'], [6063, 6073, 'COUNTRY'], [6170, 6176, 'COUNTRY'], [6181, 6192, 'COUNTRY'], [6241, 6245, 'DATE'], [6251, 6283, 'ORGANISATION'], [6444, 6455, 'STATE'], [6721, 6725, 'DATE'], [6747, 6751, 'DATE'], [7100, 7116, 'NAME'], [7674, 7679, 'NAME'], [7786, 7809, 'NAME'], [7855, 7862, 'CITY'], [8115, 8132, 'NAME'], [8285, 8297, 'NAME'], [8298, 8324, 'NAME'], [8821, 8832, 'NAME'], [8866, 8869, 'ORGANISATION'], [8931, 8942, 'STATE'], [8946, 8951, 'DATE'], [9091, 9095, 'DATE'], [9097, 9101, 'DATE'], [9107, 9112, 'DATE'], [9182, 9186, 'DATE'], [9191, 9195, 'DATE'], [9238, 9245, 'DISTRICT'], [9249, 9256, 'DATE'], [9257, 9267, 'DATE'], [9396, 9408, 'NAME'], [9424, 9431, 'CITY'], [9435, 9461, 'DISTRICT'], [9481, 9491, 'COUNTRY'], [9535, 9544, 'DATE'], [9659, 9671, 'AREA'], [9675, 9702, 'DATE'], [9813, 9816, 'DATE'], [9846, 9858, 'DATE']]}], ['By Govindraj EthirajMumbai: The total number of COVID-19 cases in India has now crossed the 5 million mark. In Mumbai, the number is now over 175,000 with over 8,200 deaths. The hospital beds in the city, particularly in intensive care units, seem to be under much greater pressure than they were until a few weeks ago. Why is this happening? How is the administration responding to this?Indiaspend spoke to Gautam Bhansali, a specialist in general medicine and infectious diseases at Bombay Hospital in south Mumbai. He is also the chief coordinator between the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the civic body, and the private hospitals in the city for managing the beds.Edited excerpts:Why is it that after a few months, we are suddenly seeing a sudden pressure on hospital beds, including intensive care units?We were in a much better position in July and August. In September, we have definitely seen a big surge in the number of cases. There are two or three reasons for it: One is that the lockdown has almost entirely been relaxed, and people are also coming from other places for treatment. Due to that, you could say, it is like a second wave--cases have increased in Mumbai. But we need to understand why the lockdown was enforced. It was to educate people, spread awareness as to what is to be done to fight COVID-19. It is a new disease, a new challenge and a new learning for everybody. Meanwhile, we needed to prepare health infrastructure. Our health infrastructure was not ready when this disease struck us, around March. We needed to create negative pressure in the ICUs and in the ward, set up different entry and exit points (for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients).Now that the number of cases has increased, we are totally geared up with enough beds. There was some shortage of beds in between. We closed down some nursing homes one month back because there were some issues there--complaints of overcharging and high mortality rate. Those issues have been almost sorted out.You are talking about those 73 nursing homes that were taken off COVID-19 duty. Of these, 27 have now been reopened. Is that correct?On 14 September, we had a meeting with the municipal commissioner and the chief minister--as the number of cases has increased, and we assume that the number is going to increase further. Plus, there is an influx of patients from other places too--from Sangli, Dhule, Kolhapur, Nasik, Pune, etc. Cases are coming to Mumbai from all over the state. People want to get treated in Mumbai because they feel Mumbai has better health infrastructure, best doctors, skilled health professionals and that they will get the best treatment. So, we opened the 27 nursing homes, which have more than 25 beds each. They are well regulated, have MD doctors (with advanced medical degrees) and critical care specialists.If you have 100 beds, for instance, how many are now occupied by people from outside Mumbai?About 30 percent to 40 percent of the people admitted in these hospitals--nursing homes and big private hospitals--are from outside the Mumbai metropolitan region--from Bhiwandi, Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, etc.And what would that number be for pre-COVID times--for instance, at this time last year?People come to Mumbai for treatment from across the country, and from other countries as well, because Mumbai has the best health infrastructure, especially in private hospitals. So, Mumbai is also a destination for medical tourism. So, last year at this time, about 60% to 70% of patients would have been from other parts of the country and abroad.But now, with COVID-19, we are facing a different situation, which needs different bed arrangement, management etc., which is why it is a problem when 30 percent to 40 percent of COVID-19 beds are occupied by people from outside Mumbai.There is a misconception that all industries have collapsed, except the hospital industry ï¿½ which (people think) is flourishing. But hospitals, mainly private hospitals, are in a big loss--because of the COVID-19 situation, the rate is capped by the government. We cannot charge more than that. There are not many non-COVID-19 patients.So proportionately today, you have a much higher ratio of patients coming from outside Mumbai, which is placing a load on the system because a fair number of beds are dedicated only for COVID-19. Is that correct?Correct. For instance, in Bombay Hospital, we have two buildings--one for COVID, and one for non-COVID. The COVID building is always full. In the non-COVID building, people have started coming now. Earlier, they were in panic; they did not want to go to a hospital for fear of catching COVID-19. People are coming now, but still surgeries are only emergencies; a few elective surgeries are going on.So, if a patient were to have a non-COVID situation, they are likely to get a bed, even in an ICU, in Mumbai?Yes, non-COVID is totally open. There are beds. There is no problem with availability of beds for the non-COVID patients.What is the total number of beds you are managing, in a way, in the private hospital space in Mumbai?Right now, in the 33 big private hospitals--like Bombay Hospital, Breach Candy, Hinduja, Lilavati, Jaslok, etc ï¿½ we have 2,600 COVID-19 beds. Of these, 1,600 are oxygenated beds, and 590 ICU beds. In the 27 nursing homes we opened, we added 390 ICU beds and 1,700 oxygenated beds. In the government hospitals, we reduced the capacity of COVID beds because we opened up the non-COVID part also. For instance, Nair hospital was totally a dedicated COVID hospital. Now, 50 percent beds are for COVID and 50 percent for non-COVID.But we have increased capacity in our jumbo facilities. We have 11,000 oxygenated beds in these facilities--like in NSCI Worli, BKC, NESCO, Dahisar, Mulund. Jumbo facilities are not isolation or quarantine centres. They are full-fledged hospitals, with oxygenated beds, ventilators, bi-pap machines, nasal cannula machine, X-ray, sonography, 2D echo and a pathology lab in every facility. They have all kinds of medication ï¿½ including the likes of] remidesivir, tocilizumab ï¿½ and it is totally free of cost.We inspected the jumbo facilities to understand why people are not coming. There is a perception that these are only quarantine or isolation centres. As I said, they are full-fledged hospitals. Secondly, they feel the doctors may not be good. All the jumbo facilities will now be run by government medical college and hospital staff--like Sion, Nair and KEM hospitals. They already deployed two units each--each unit has 40-50 doctors. Further, all jumbo facilities will be monitored by big private hospitals--Bombay Hospital and Breach Candy will monitor the NSCI Worli Dome. Lilavati and Hinduja, which have top expert doctors, will look after the BKC jumbo facility. NESCO Goregaon facility will be looked after by Kokilaben and Nanavati hospitals. Mulund facility will be looked after by Fortis Hospital.Are there enough doctors and nurses to manage the patients in private hospitals, nursing homes and the jumbo facilities?Yes, in private hospitals and nursing homes, there is no shortage of doctors. In government [MCGM or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] hospitals too, there was no shortage of doctors and nurses. The only staff and manpower shortage we were facing was in the jumbo facilities. That is why we deployed medical college and hospital staff in these facilities. Further, we deployed top expert doctors from the private hospitals for ICU care. So from yesterday, there is no shortage of any staff in the jumbo facility.As an infectious disease specialist, looking at the patient flow, and at the condition in which they are coming to the hospital today, what is your sense on where we are in terms of management of this disease?This is a new disease, there are new challenges and learnings everyday. Every day, we change our guidelines. Sometimes we say that patients who are above 50 years should be hospitalised. Sometimes again, we say that for asymptomatic patients, home isolation is better.We are seeing that the virulence of this disease has decreased. Now, patients are not as critical as they were during April-June. That was a horrible time. Maybe patients are educated enough, they are keeping their diabetes controlled, taking enough precautions--and now, enough medications such as remdesivir are available. That definitely helps us a lot--it does not stop the virus, but reduces the viral load. So I feel, with the availability of medications, beds and oxygen, [we are able to manage better]. Oxygen is more important than a ventilator. Every patient does not need a ventilator.You are saying that most additional load that we are seeing, particularly in the ICUs, is because of patients coming from outside Mumbai. Is that likely to reduce or increase? And therefore, are we back to a situation like we had in May or June, even as the disease itself does not spread as much, but the patient load is continuing to rise?I feel the patient load will continue to rise till the end of September. After that, things will settle down. After the first week of October, I think the number of cases may decrease. But if it increases, we are totally geared up with the facilities. We have (enough) beds. In the jumbo facilities, 30-40 percent beds are still vacant; in private hospitals, 10-20 percent beds are vacant; in ICUs, 1-3 percent beds are vacant. It does not mean they are vacant all the time; but there is constant turnover.Earlier, we were doing only 4,000 tests per day in Mumbai. Mumbai is the first city to allow tests without a doctorï¿½s prescription. Now everyday, we are doing 15,000 to 16,000 tests. We are chasing the virus. We are not worried about the numbers. We want to decrease the mortality rate and we are able to decrease it.\\r', {'entities': []}], ['Farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are peeved at being blamed for Delhiï¿½s smog. ï¿½We have been burning crop residue for the past 50 years now,ï¿½ said a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union from Haryana, who does not want to be named. ï¿½If anybody is affected, it should be the surrounding villages. We donï¿½t face any such problem. So why is this problem in Delhi seen just during these past few years?ï¿½Every winter, not just Delhi but also large parts of north India are frequently enveloped in a thick blanket of smog, caused by air pollution from vehicular and industrial emissions mixing with fog. The burning of post-harvest paddy stubble in the agricultural fields of Haryana and Punjab is often cited as a major cause of this unhealthy smog.This year, health experts fear that the effects of COVID-19, which primarily causes respiratory problems, would be worsened by heightened air pollution due to smog and smoke from the annual stubble burning.According to a report by The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), last year, from October to December, air pollution in New Delhi and other cities in north India was up to 20 times higher than the safe threshold levels defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO).It is estimated that Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of rice stubble, 80 percent of which is burnt. According to the TERI report, due to labour shortages during COVID-19, paddy transplantation date was advanced to 10 June this year. However, this is unlikely to contain stubble burning. Why burnFarmers resort to burning of crop residue due to the short time window available to sow the next wheat crop. Traditionally, older farmers in Punjab and Haryana recall, very little paddy was sown as wheat, not rice, is the staple diet in the region. However, with the advent of the Green Revolution, a rice-wheat crop rotation has become the norm, under which specialised short-duration varieties were introduced.Rice is grown between June and October, followed by wheat from November to April. Any delay in sowing of wheat adversely affects crop yield. As farmers get barely 20-25 days between the two crops, the easiest way to clear the field is burning the crop residue instead of the more time-consuming mechanical route. Which is also quite expensive, say farmers.In 2013, under the Air Act, 1981, the Punjab government banned the burning of crop residue in the fields. Later, in 2015, the National Green Tribunal prohibited the burning of paddy straw while directing the government to help farmers manage the paddy straw using specialised equipment like Happy Seeder that chops paddy straw, sows wheat seeds and layers the straw as a mulch. Other machines like Rotavator, that bundle the straw into bales to be transported, were also to be procured and used.Punjab Agriculture department officials said about 20,000 pieces of farm equipment were supplied to Punjab farmers in 2019 under a centrally sponsored scheme to promote mechanisation. In the previous year, 28,000 machines were given out. Despite that, according to official data, Punjab witnessed over 22,000 incidents of stubble burning till November 2019.Machines of contentionAs a solution for the current year, the Punjab and Haryana governments submitted an Action Plan to a Supreme Court mandated panel to check stubble burning. The plan promises farmers easier accessibility to machinery that manages crop residue.But with just a few weeks to go before the fields are cleared post-harvest for the kharif, or winter, wheat sowing, there appears to be little momentum to implement this Action Plan. Especially as no systems are yet in place to enable farmers to hire machines at affordable rates.As things stand, it seems it will be business as usual, particularly with the state governments forced to use available personnel and resources in battling the pandemic.ï¿½The paddy crop is still standing which we will begin harvesting next month,ï¿½ says Ekta Sukhdev Singh, a farmer in Kukarikalan village of Punjab. ï¿½We have to begin sowing wheat in December but as of now, no arrangements have been made for any stubble clearing machinesï¿½.Under the Action Plan, the two state governments are to set up more Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) to rent out machinery to farmers who cannot afford to buy the high-end machinery, besides supplying more balersï¿½a machine used to compress stubble into compact bales.Punjab claims it has set up 7,378 CHCs over the past two years and has announced another 5,200 CHCs will be set up this year to meet the target of having one CHC in each village. Haryana has set up 2,879 CHCs and 2,000 more will be established by October, the government has said.CHCs are machine banks that rent out expensive machines to farmers, who cannot afford to buy them. The CHCs generally comprise cooperative societies, private entrepreneurs, informal farmersï¿½ groups or FPOs (Farmer Producer Organisations). The machines, which are rented out to farmers, are bought at a subsidised cost.The machines donï¿½t come cheap. A Super Seeder costs Rs 2.1 lakh; Happy Seeder Rs 1.5-1.75 lakh; Rotavator Rs 1.15 lakh; Mulcher Rs 1.7 lakh; MB Plough Rs 2 lakh; and Baler Rs 14 to 20 lakh. But the CHCs get financial assistance of 80 per cent from the Centre.The Union government has also launched a multilingual mobile app, CHC Farm Machinery to help farmers hire machinery from CHCs located within 50 km radius of their farms.Where does the money go?The Centre launched a scheme, ï¿½Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the State of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh & NCT of Delhiï¿½ with a total outgo of Rs 1151.80 crore for the period 2018-19 to 2019-20. During 2019-20, funds amounting to Rs 273.80 crore, Rs 192.06 crore and Rs 105.29 crore have also been released to the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, respectively.In its 2020-21 Budget announced on February 28th, Haryana government allocated Rs 454 crore for management of crop residue. Besides, last month, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal introduced a comprehensive Rs 1,304 crore plan for crop residue management. The Punjab government allocated Rs 20 crore for crop residue management for the fiscal 2020-21.The machines need an around 45 hp (horse power) tractor to operate, working at a rate of 0.25-0.35 hectares per hour. Their operating constrains include a lower machine capacity as compared to conventional seed drills and inability to operate in wet straw.For the small farmers, the cost of hiring the machine is steep. Moreover, there is no standardized rental rate. Farmers can end up paying anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000 per acre. For the farmers it makes more sense to pay a fine of Rs 2,500 on paddy burning than hire a machine.ï¿½Farmers are in favour of deploying the machines as burning stubble leads to a massive loss of natural productive elements, such as micro-organisms and useful worms and insects, which get burnt in the process,ï¿½ says Sukhdev Singh, a member of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). ï¿½Moreover, precious organic material also gets burntï¿½.Environmental scientists estimate that for every acre of land where paddy straw is burnt, there is a loss of 5.5 kg ofnitrogen, 2.3 kg phosphates, 25 kg potassium and about two tonnes of manure. As for emissions, about three tons of carbon dioxide, 120 kg of carbon monoxide, six kg of particulate matter, four kg of sulphur dioxide, and 400 kg of ash are released per acre.ï¿½Systems should also be in place to sell the straw or stubble, which can be used in a variety of ways, from electricity generation and manure to manufacture of furniture, bedding material, flooring and tiles,ï¿½ added Sukhdev Singh. ï¿½A farmer cannot be expected to go about selling the stubble. Mechanisms that make economic sense for farmers and factories would be win-win for allï¿½.Operational challengesVarious experts have recommended a holistic approach to tackle this problem. While mechanised management of crop residue is needed, it should make economic sense.ï¿½We should stop blaming the farmers, instead we should propose methods that are economically and ecologically desirable,ï¿½ said eminent agricultural scientist Dr MS Swaminathan in an e-mail response. ï¿½Since the organic matter content of our soils is low, I have recommended that the rice straw, which is being burnt in Punjab and Haryana, should be incorporated in the soil to improve both soil physics and moisture holding capacityï¿½.CHC as a concept is not new, says Chandrakant Pradhan, Lead-Climate Change Resilience, CII Foundation. Over the last two years, Punjab has been setting them up through cooperative societies, which are encouraged to buy machines at a subsidized cost and rent them out to farmers. Entrepreneurs, informal farmersï¿½ groups and FPOs (Farmer Producer Organisations) are also eligible to set up CHCs.Haryana is promoting CHCs mostly through entrepreneurs or through informal groups of farmers. ï¿½Success of the scheme this season, however, will primarily depend on how effectively demand for large scale use of machines is created,ï¿½ Pradhan said.According to ICAR, Punjab is likely to see paddy cultivation in around 27 lakh hectares (ha) this season. This is down from 31 lakh ha last year. The state average productivity is about 3.9 tonnes/ha. Around 200 lakh tonnes of paddy straw is generated per year.Haryana has about 13 lakh ha under rice cultivation. The stateï¿½s average productivity is about 3.1 tonnes/ha. Around 12 lakh tonnes of paddy straw is generated every year in the state.The operational challenges vary depending upon the ownership structure. Sukhdev Singh said big farmers hire most of the machines. ï¿½Farmers with 2-4 acre land holdings are left out,ï¿½ he said.Corroborating this, Pradhan said private CHCs tend to associate mostly with farmers with large land holdings, who have the resources to pay the hiring charges. Such farmers come together to form CHCs and once they get the subsidy benefit on the machines they keep the machines for their own use and do not rent them out to others, which defeats the whole purpose of the CHC.ï¿½It is not yet clear whether the CHC is a viable business model in the long run,ï¿½ adds Pradhan. ï¿½The capital cost requirement is significant even after subsidy. Considering that O&M (operation and maintenance) cost is also high, it remains to be seen how the business model play out in the long runï¿½. Cost deterrentQuality and after sales services are the other sticky issues. But the main deterrent is the high cost of the machines, even with the subsidy. ï¿½Typically, a cooperative would require 6-10 machines, for which they need to pay about Rs 5-6 lakh after subsidy,ï¿½ says Pradhan.ï¿½We have been giving a subsidy of 50 percent to individual farmers and 80 percent to cooperative societies for buying farm machines,ï¿½ an official said. The National Green Tribunal order had directed the government to supply machinery free of cost to farmers owning less than two acres of land.However, farmers are demanding a bonus of around Rs 200 per quintal or Rs 3,000 per acre while procuring paddy, as incentive to those who do not burn stubble. Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had last year written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a compensation of Rs 100 per quintal of paddy as incentive.ï¿½Our demand is Rs 5,000 per acre,ï¿½ said Sukhdev Singh, adding that last yearï¿½s compensation had not yet been given. The way forwardï¿½We always adopt the ï¿½donï¿½tï¿½ philosophy and not the ï¿½doï¿½ philosophy, which I have been advocating for a long time,ï¿½ said Dr MS Swaminathan. Farmers would like to remove the rice stubble on time for sowing wheat. One way, Swaminathan points out, is the environmentally destructive method of burning the straw in the field leading to smog. The other is to find economic use of the straw.ï¿½While Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh are rich in rice straw, it is not used as animal fodder, while states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka lack enough animal feed. It will be ideal if the fodder deficient states tie up with Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. It could be a win-win situation both for the farmers and for the environment,ï¿½ he said.ï¿½Providing machinery is just one part of the solution,ï¿½ adds Pradhan. ï¿½Farmers also need training to run these machines to get optimum results. Lack of such training discourages farmers from using these machines as they donï¿½t get desired results.ï¿½All of this means Delhi is unlikely to get any relief from burning, smoke and smog this year too.This article was first published in Citizen Matters, a civic media website and is republished here with permission.

They are an integral part of the social and economic fabric of the town... If the demolition of slums is carried out amidst the current pandemic, more than 2,50,000 persons will be forced to move around the city in search for shelter and livelihood,ï¿½ Maken said in his submission to the court, according to the newspaper.As per rough estimates, there are around 2,40,000 people living in slums in Naraina Vihar, Azadpur, Vihar, Shakur Basti, Mayapuri, Sriniwaspuri, Anand Parbat and Okhla among others.The Central Government, in response to Maken\\'s plea, clarified on Monday that it had no immediate plans to uproot over 2 lakh families in the middle of the pandemic, adding thatï¿½discussions were underway between the Union Ministry of Urban Housing Development, the Railways and the Government of NCT of Delhi to implement the top court\\'s order,ï¿½Hindustan Times reported.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also assured the slum residents that no sudden coercive action will be taken against them and that their representatives will be invited to be a part of the consultations deciding the fate of the slum residents.The Delhi government also clarified that any resettlement of rehabilitation will have to be done as per theï¿½Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015.According to the said policy, residents of jhuggi jhopri clustersï¿½which have come up before 01 January 2006 shall not be removed without rehabilitation. Furthermore, the policy favours in-situ rehabilitation ï¿½ which provides for alternative accomodation in the same place as the slum cluster.The residents association welcomed the statements made by the Central and state governments, but decided to go ahead with the protest to seek a lasting solution to the problem.Among other things, the residents have demadned to be consulted during the planning, the rehabilitation plan prioritisesï¿½in-situ upgradation, and thatï¿½resettlement should be treated only as a last resort.The slum dwellers feel that the timing of the Supreme Court order was particularly harsh as the poor had been already reeling under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown.Forty-eight-year-old Veeramma, who works as a domestic help in the nearby domestic clusters, says that the pandemic took away her entire family\\'s livelihood and now the court\\'s order could mean that she may also become homeless.\"My husband cannot move. My son is a daily wager, he doesn\\'t have much work, too. We don\\'t have enough ration to feed the family for another week,\" said Veeramma looking at her two-year-old granddaughter, a third generation to be born in the slum cluster.\"We don\\'t have the money for my granddaughterï¿½s milk. Even if we beg, we wonï¿½t get anything. The times were never so bad,\" she told PTI.Elumalai, 35, reminded the government\\'\\'s promise of \"jahan jhuggi wahin makan\" made before the elections.\"We do not say we won\\'t accept the court\\'\\'s order. This land belongs to the railways and they will take it one day, but where will we go? No one cares for us,\" Elumalai, whose father came to Delhi from Chennai in 1978, told PTI.Interestingly, each household in the slum has got electricity connection, Aadhaar card, voter id, and ration card, the news agency reported.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had built community toilets for the slum dwellers last year, so that no one defecates in the open or on the tracks, Shankar Sarangam, a driver told PTI.\"The salary has been reduced by half. I have a family to feed. We were thankful to god that we have a roof over our head. Now the jhuggi will be gone, too. The railways should have at least considered the timing of the move.

Her doctor has advised her to take a break from the occupation, but this is an option she can ill-afford.\"If I stop doing this work even for a while, the contractors will stop giving me work altogether. How will I sustain my family then?ï¿½ she asks. Kowsalya, a resident of Nettur village in Tirunelveli district, earns a meagre Rs 140 for every set of one thousand beedis she rolls. This income, along with her husbandï¿½s who works as a coolie, is what keeps the household running. The COVID-19 lockdown has meant lesser work and dwindling earnings for the couple, and they worry about how they will pay their two sonsï¿½ school fees in the future.Kowsalya is one of 460 women interviewed by AF Development Care, a New Delhi-based research consulting agency, for a study on the living conditions of beedi workers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Out of the total respondents, 400 women presently work as beedi rollers while the remaining 60 have now left the occupation.What did the study find:The research found that a large number of workers frequently suffer from cough, fatigue, body ache, etc. Worryingly, the study also found that they spend an average of Rs 7,248 per year on medical expenses, which amounts to 29.2 percent of their annual income they earn through the occupation.R Amutha, 48, has been rolling beedis for thirty years now, and earns Rs 200 for every set of 1,000 hand-rolled cigarettes. Neerad PandharipandeWhile the exorbitant yearly health expense is one indicator of how the job takes a toll on the workers, many women also listed out other serious health issues that came with the occupation. ï¿½Lower back painï¿½ was the ailment that was most widely cited, with as many as 45.3 percent of the women saying that they suffered it either ï¿½frequentlyï¿½ or ï¿½always.ï¿½Similarly, 43.5 percent of the respondents experienced body ache either ï¿½frequentlyï¿½ or ï¿½alwaysï¿½. For other symptoms of ill health such as breathing difficulty, cough and abdominal pain, the corresponding figures are 18.6 percent, 13.3 percent and 18.8 respectively.While beedi rolling takes a significant toll on health of the workers, the amount of money they earn through it is paltry ï¿½ on an average Rs 24,787 per year. Women beedi rollers in Karnataka earn slightly better (Rs 26,266) than their counterparts in Tamil Nadu (Rs 23,307), the study found.In comparison, the average annual income of women who shifted from beedi rolling to alternative occupations was significantly high at Rs 58,431.In a previous study, AF Development Care had analysed data from the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) to show that in 2011-2012, as many as 96 percent of beedi workers were home-based, while only 4 percent worked in factories. Out of the workers who worked from home, 83.7 percent were women and 16.3 percent were men.The study also found significantï¿½gender gap in terms of payï¿½- women, on an average, earn Rs 126 per day while the men make Rs 266 per day. The average earning fir women is even lower than the national minimum wageï¿½which is set at Rs 178 by the Code on Wages, 2019.Beedi industry is only one such in India where the workers get wages based on the number of units (in this case, number of beedis) they produce. As notedï¿½inï¿½an article in the Pulitzer Center, other industries take into account both - the time-rate (amount of time spent at the job) and the piece-rate (the number of units of the commodity that are produced), into account.It is little surprising then that over half of the beedi rollers interviewed for the study (53.8 percent) said that they wanted to shift to alternate occupations.Low pay, tough working conditionsR Amutha, 48ï¿½andï¿½ï¿½resident of Ukkirankottai village in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu is one of thoseï¿½who expressed the desire to leave the profession. She has been rolling beedis for thirty years now, and earns Rs 200 for every set of 1,000 hand-rolled cigarettes.Speaking to Firstpost, Amutha said that she will be happy to take up an alternative job if she gets a better opportunity. Describing her ardous routine, she said, ï¿½I have to finish my chores early in the morning, after which I make beedis from 9 am to 4 pm. I take a break for a few hours, and then again do the same work for a few hours in the evening. I often suffer headaches, body ache, and pain in the hands and legs because of the work that I do.ï¿½Another woman from her village, M Chithirai Kani, left beedi rolling a year ago, and although she is facing hard times on the economic front, she does not intend to go back to her old job. She said, ï¿½After I left beedi rolling, I took up a job as a helper at a hotel, for which I earned Rs 8,000 a month. However, the hotel was closed recently. Now, I am working on my farm, but the rains have been scarce this year. If my farm income is not enough, I will work as a labourer on other peopleï¿½s farms, or take up work under the MGNREGS. But I will certainly not take up beedi-making again. I was paid only Rs 150-200 for every thousand beedis, and I often suffered from headaches and body aches due to the nature of the work.ï¿½M Chithirai Kani, left beedi rolling a year ago, and although she is facing hard times on the economic front, she does not intend to go back to her old job. Neerad PandharipandeJamila Begum, a resident of the Channapatna town in Karnatakaï¿½s Ramanagara district, has also drastically cut down on beedi rolling on her doctorï¿½s advice. She said, ï¿½I used to get only Rs 150 for every set of 1,000 beedis. However, I often used to suffer from breathing difficulties and body ache because of it. Of late, I have also been suffering from heart-related ailments. I have two sons and they have started working as labourers now. So, I have now more or less stopped beedi rolling in the past two years.ï¿½Occupational health hazards such as the ones described above are only to be expected given the present nature of beedi-making further, says Sachi Satapathy, the principal investigator of the study conducted by AF Development Care. Speaking to Firstpost, he said, ï¿½Women who roll beedis have to inhale tobacco dust throughout the time that they are working. They also have to remain in a particular sitting position for several hours at a stretch, sometimes in houses without adequate ventilation. These women are grossly underpaid and exploited. What makes matters worse is that even though they are prone to many long-term ailments, healthcare facilities in rural areas are often inadequate. This can mean that their illnesses can remain undiagnosed.ï¿½Satapathy further remarked, ï¿½At present, because a large proportion of beedi rollers are home-based, they do not get the benefit of labour laws. The government must urgently formulate a strong and effective policy that is aimed at regulating the working conditions of these workers.ï¿½K Satish, a member of the data collection team for the study, said, ï¿½These women, especially the poorer ones, are often exploited by contractors who give them work. This exploitation happens by giving the women sub-standard raw material, and then ï¿½rejectingï¿½ a certain percentage of beedis by saying that they are of inferior quality. The contractors keep even the ï¿½rejectedï¿½ beedis but do not pay the women for them.ï¿½The study has emphasised that not only should beedi rollers be provided training for alternative occupations, but it should also be ensured that there is an economically viable market for the alternative skills.Broadly, what becomes clear from the study is that improving the condition of beedi workers will require a combination of legal safeguards as well as alternative economic opportunities.\\r', {'entities': []}], [\"The construction of Atal tunnel, the world`s longest highway tunnel above 10,000 feet, connecting Manali with Leh has finally been completed after 10 years. As per news agency ANI, KP Purushothaman, chief engineer of the project, said on Wednesday that the tunnel will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 kilometres and save four hours of travel. The tunnel is equipped with CCTV cameras at every 60 metres and there are emergency exits at every 500 metres inside the tunnel. Fire hydrants too have been installed inside the tunnel in case of any fire incident, the report added.As per a report by Times Now, the tunnel, which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month is 8.8 kilometres long. It is built at an altitude of over 3,000 metres above sea level in the Pir Panjal ranges of Himachal Pradesh.The report adds that the strategically crucial tunnel ensuring all-weather connectivity between Manali and Leh assumes an important position during the ongoing tensions between India and China along the Line of Actual Control. It will ensure that the route remains open and well connected, even during winter when heavy snowfall blocks the Rohtang pass.Named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the tunnel is 10.5 metres wide and has a height of 5.52 metres. A car can go up to a speed of 80 kilometres inside the tunnel. Furthermore, a single tube bi-lane tunnel with a fire-proof emergency egress tunnel has been built into the main tunnel itself.It is also the country's first tunnel to have an escape tunnel within the main tunnel which would provide an emergency exit in case of an untoward incident. The tunnel is also the first to deploy the Rowa flyer technology, which allowed engineers to work at inverted levels.The 0riginal estimated time for the construction of the tunnel was less than six years. According to Satish Paretkar, director of hydro and underground business unit at Afcons, the company which built the tunnel, the delay in completion of the tunnel was mainly due to the 410-metre long brook, Seri Nalla.Conceived way back in 1983 by the Indira Gandhi government, it was only in 2002 that the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government gave its nod and laid the foundation for the approach road to the tunnel and the project began to move only in September 2009. The cost of the project has crossed Rs 2,500 crore.\\r\", {'entities': [[0, 31, 'INCIDENT'], [98, 104, 'CITY'], [110, 113, 'CITY'], [114, 156, 'INCIDENT'], [181, 197, 'NAME'], [297, 303, 'CITY'], [308, 311, 'CITY'], [678, 691, 'NAME'], [798, 808, 'AREA'], [819, 839, 'STATE'], [932, 938, 'CITY'], [943, 946, 'CITY'], [1013, 1018, 'COUNTRY'], [1023, 1028, 'COUNTRY'], [1176, 1183, 'AREA'], [1223, 1243, 'NAME'], [1874, 1889, 'NAME'], [2068, 2088, 'AREA'], [2101, 2105, 'DATE'], [2113, 2126, 'NAME'], [2154, 2158, 'DATE'], [2173, 2193, 'NAME'], [2316, 2331, 'DATE']]}], ['A member of the NCB team probing drugs angle in actor Sushant Singh Rajput\\'s death case tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday following which questioning of the actor\\'s former manager Shruti Modi was postponed, an official said.Modi reached the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) office in south Mumbai around 10 am for questioning by the Special Investigation Team (SIT).But, before the probe team could start recording her statement, the NCB received the report of one of its SIT members testing positive for coronavirus, the official said.The SIT member\\'s antigen test came out positive, he said, adding that other members of the probe team will also be tested and all protocols will be followed.\"Accordingly, we sent back Shruti Modi who had joined the investigation in the morning,\" he said.The NCB on Tuesday asked Shruti Modi and Rajput\\'s talent manager Jaya Saha to join its investigation to get a clear picture on some aspects of the case.Saha will now be called later, the official said.Asian News International tweeted the development.Read the tweet belowOne of the members of SIT has tested positive for #COVID19.

In 2020, Vishwakarma Jayanti is being observed on 16 September.Lord Vishwakarma and myths surrounding himThe son of Vastu Dev and Goddess Angisri, he is the god of craftsmen and creators. It was Lord Vishwakarma who helped Brahma create the universe and make a map of the entire world. As per mythology, Lord Vishwakarma constructed the holy city of Dwarka which Lord Krishna ruled. Fearing attack from Jarasangh and Kaalayvan on Mathura, Shri Krishna and Yadavas left Mathura and arrived at the coast of Saurashtra. Once they reached the coast, Lord Krishna worshipped Samudradev, who, pleased with his prayers, gave them land measuring 12 yojans. Lord Vishwakarma build Dwarka, a \"city in gold\" at this place.Yet another legend ties the divine architect with Lord Jagannath in Odisha. According to legends, when King Indradyumna wanted to install the idols of Lord Vishnu in the temple, Vishwakarma came to the king in the garb of an old man and said he could turn the log the king had found into the desired image, provided he was allowed to work without any disturbance.Lord Vishwakarma just had one condition that he should not be disturbed or else he would leave creating the idols midway. However, the king could not control himself and opened the doors of the workshop. Vishwakarma disappeared and the king was left with the three incomplete idols of Krishna, Balaram and Subhadra.Lord Vishwakarma is also credited with creating the Maya Sabha for the Pandavas. In Rig Veda, he is credited with Sthapatya Veda, the science of mechanics and architecture.Vishwakarma Puja timingVishwakarma Puja celebrations are done according to Bisuddhasidhanta. As per Drikpanchang, this year Vishwakarma Puja Sankranti starts at 7.23 pm on 16 September.The festival is primarily celebrated in factories and industrial areas, as well as shops. The festival is celebrated by engineers, architects, mechanics and others.
